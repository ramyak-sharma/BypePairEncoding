# Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) Implementation

This project implements a **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)** algorithm in C++ â€” a powerful compression and tokenization technique often used in NLP and modern AI models like GPT.

---

## Features
-  Encodes input text into compressed tokens using BPE
-  Supports decoding to reconstruct the original text
-  Tracks token merges in a vocabulary table
-  Outputs a **Graphviz** `.dot` file to visualize token merges as a tree. 
-  Memoization improves decoding speed
-  **NOTE:** The Graphviz Code is generated by AI
