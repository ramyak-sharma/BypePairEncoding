# Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) Implementation

This project implements a **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)** algorithm in C++ â€” a powerful compression and tokenization technique often used in NLP and modern AI models like GPT.

---

## Features
-  Encodes input text into compressed tokens using BPE
-  Supports decoding to reconstruct the original text
-  Tracks token merges in a vocabulary table
-  Outputs a **Graphviz** `.dot` file to visualize token merges as a tree. 
-  Memoization improves decoding speed
-  **NOTE:** The Graphviz Code is generated by AI

## Installation and Setup

### **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:ramyak-sharma/BypePairEncoding.git
cd BypePairEncoding
```
## How to use
- Change the content of "text.txt" to what to wish.

### Dependencies
- CMake
- Graphviz

### Build
- Run the following commands on terminal after cloning.
```
mkdir build && cd build
```
```
cmake ..
```
```
make
```
```
./bpe_encoder
```
- You will get an output `bpe_graph.dot`.
- Then run the following command on the terminal:
```
dot -Tpng -Gdpi=1500 bpe_graph.dot -o bpe_graph.png
```
- if the quality seems too low, increase the Gdpi.
